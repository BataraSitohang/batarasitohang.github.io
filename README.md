Hello there! I'm Batara

I'm a mechanical engineering graduate student at a high school in Medan, North Sumatera-indonesia. I used to work as an engineer and document staff for telecommunication network. I understand and able to operate computer, maintenance and troubleshoot, repair, hardware and software installation, and also internet. My specialization is drafting (autocad), front end web (web design), computer maintenance and troubleshoot, OS installation (Windows). 

My hobby is reading, watching movies, listening to the musics and traveling. I love technology. If I have free time I usually make a web design. Web design is not my career but, i love to learn about it, i learned it from anyother source, and it has been for years now. I also create some website templates. My passions is to make accessible, simple and easy web design. I'm using modern technology html5 and css3 to create easy and responsive web design, tested and compatible with all majors browsers.
